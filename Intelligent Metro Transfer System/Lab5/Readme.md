# Instructions for Lab 5

You are given, in this folder, the following set of files.

1. S3. py: This is going to serve as a reference file for your usage. 

The suggested files & file structure for this week's assignment is:

2. gatherData.py : 		A simple data collection program that collects and stores information in a csv file.
3. buildTrainingDataSet.py: 	Using the pandas library to help clean out and clear out some of the data.
4. createAMLmodel.py:		This involves using the data above. The reader must choose a model (Regression,Classification)  

Part 3 of the Assignment this week entails the usage of the pushtoKinesis.py function. This is a stand-alone complete function in 
itself and should be executable as is (after changing the stream name in the code)

5. index.js.template:		Based on the AWSLabs example, this is the template js file for your Lambda coding.
